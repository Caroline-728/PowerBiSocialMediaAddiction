# PowerBiSocialMediaAddiction
Power bi report analysing social media usage and it's impact on students 

Project Summary:
"Education for All" commissioned a global student survey to explore how social media usage relates to mental health, academic performance, and sleep. This dashboard summarizes key findings from a sample of 250 students across multiple countries. Users can filter the dashboard by country, gender, or academic level to explore trends in more detail.

The following questions were requested by stakeholders from education for all :


1.	Addiction Prevalence
  -	What percentage of students meet the criteria for social media addiction?
  - How does this vary by country, gender, or academic level?
2.	Impact on Mental Health
  -	Are students with high usage or “addicted” status more likely to report lower mental health scores?
  - Are there visible differences in mental health by gender or region?
3.	Academic Performance Risk
  - How many students report that social media negatively affects their academic performance?
  - Is there a relationship between daily usage hours and reported academic issues?
4.	Sleep Disruption
  - What proportion of students sleep fewer than 6 hours per night?
  - Does sleep deprivation correlate with higher social media usage?
5.	Platform Usage Trends
  -  What are the most used platforms?
  - Are certain platforms more associated with negative outcomes
