# PowerBiSocialMediaAddiction
Power bi report analysing social media usage and it's impact on students 

Project Summary:
"Education for All" commissioned a global student survey to explore how social media usage relates to mental health, academic performance, and sleep. This dashboard summarises key findings from a sample of 250 students across multiple countries. Users can filter the dashboard by country, gender, or academic level to explore trends in more detail. The dashboard includes 3 pages and allows users to navigate between these pages using the icons on the left hand side of the report. 

Please note: Students were asked to score themselves on whether or not they were addicted to social media. We've have assigned a score above 8 to mean "Addicted". Students who reported to have less than 6 hours sleep are considered to have "Low sleep". 

The following questions were requested by stakeholders from education for all :


1.	Addiction Prevalence
  -	What percentage of students meet the criteria for social media addiction?
  - How does this vary by country, gender, or academic level?
2.	Impact on Mental Health
  -	Are students with high usage or “addicted” status more likely to report lower mental health scores?
  - Are there visible differences in mental health by gender or region?
3.	Academic Performance Risk
  - How many students report that social media negatively affects their academic performance?
  - Is there a relationship between daily usage hours and reported academic issues?
4.	Sleep Disruption
  - What proportion of students sleep fewer than 6 hours per night?
  - Does sleep deprivation correlate with higher social media usage?
5.	Platform Usage Trends
  -  What are the most used platforms?
  - Are certain platforms more associated with negative outcomes

Key Findings (All Countries – Overall View)

•	Addiction Rate:

18% of students rated themselves 8 or higher out of 10 on the self-reported addiction scale and are categorised as “addicted.”

•	Daily Social Media Usage:

The average daily use across all students is 4.5 hours per day.

•	Mental Health:

The average self-reported mental health score is 5.6 out of 10, indicating moderate wellbeing with room for improvement.

•	Sleep Deprivation:

34% of students report getting less than 6 hours of sleep per night—a potential health risk and performance concern.

•	Platform Preferences:

The most frequently used platform is Facebook (45 users), followed by TikTok (39) and YouTube (37). Snapchat is the least reported primary platform.

•	Top Surveyed Countries:

The five countries with the most responses are Denmark, China, France, Spain, and South Korea.

Trends Over Time

•	Usage Spike in Q2 2022:
Daily usage peaked at 5.9 hours/day in Q2 2022, a 62.6% increase compared to the lowest point of 3.6 hours/day in Q1 2024.

•	Post-Spike Decline:

After the 2022 peak, average use dropped to 3.9 hours/day by Q4 of the same year, then stabilised between 4.5–4.9 hours/day in most quarters.

Key observations:

•	The spike in Q2 2022 may align with specific global or academic events—e.g., exam stress 

•	The decline after 2022 could reflect platform fatigue or academic pressures pushing students to limit screen time.

•	Facebook’s popularity suggests students may still rely on established platforms for communication, even while TikTok and YouTube grow in entertainment and content engagement.


Recommendations:

-	Promote Healthy Digital Habits:

- Use high-usage periods (e.g., Q2) as a trigger for targeted wellness campaigns and digital detox challenges.
- Encourage students to track and reflect on their social media time via built-in app usage monitors or university-supported tools.
- Link mental health resources with screen time guidance, particularly for students showing signs of high usage or addiction.

-	Enable Country-Specific Analysis:

- Since behaviours vary across regions, empower schools or local partners to explore the dashboard using the Country filter, enabling localised action plans.

This section explores the relationship between students’ mental health and their level of social media usage, with a breakdown by gender, country, and usage time.
Key Observations:


Gender & Addiction Impact on Mental Health:

- Among students not considered addicted, females report a slightly higher average mental health score (5.8) compared to males (5.5).
- Among those considered addicted, mental health scores are lower across both genders, with females at 4.8 and males at 5.2.
- Insight: Addiction to social media correlates with a noticeable decline in self-reported mental health, especially among females.


Country-Level Highlights:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5280c622-dafd-480e-abc9-fbdb613ea421)


- Australia stands out with the highest average mental health score of 7.3, well above the global average of 5.6.

- Male students using social media more than 8 hours/day report a perfect score of 10, while females using it 3–5 hours/day report a high score of 8.3.

- Despite high usage in some cases, only 13.3% of Australian students consider themselves addicted, lower than the global average of 18%.

- Netherlands reports zero students self-identifying as addicted, despite some having high usage (8+ hours).

- Mental health scores for high-use students remain moderate (5–6), suggesting perception of addiction may vary culturally or that students do not associate time spent with addiction.

- Females in the Netherlands report a significantly higher average mental health score (7.8) compared to males (6.2).

- The UK has the lowest average mental health score among all countries surveyed, which may merit deeper investigation into broader student wellbeing and social pressures. They have 22% addicted rate with an average mental health score of 4.2. Close behind the UK with low mental health scores are France and Denmark


Usage Time vs. Mental Health:

- Students using social media 0–2 hours daily have relatively balanced mental health scores (5.7–5.8).

- Moderate users (3–5 hours/day) see a mixed impact:
- Females: 6.3
- Males: 5.4
- Heavy users (6–7+ hours/day) show declining mental health, with scores dropping to a range of 5.0–5.5 for both genders.

- Interpretation: Light to moderate use may not harm mental health, especially for females, but usage above 6 hours appears linked with a noticeable decline

Key Observations:

- Perceived addiction and actual usage don’t always align. For instance, students in the Netherlands may use social media heavily without viewing it as problematic, while other countries report addiction at lower usage levels.

- Gender differences are notable, with females showing greater sensitivity to heavy usage in terms of mental health impact.

- Cultural and environmental factors seem to influence both mental health outcomes and perception of addiction, as seen in countries like Australia and the Netherlands.

Recommendations:

- Awareness Campaigns:
- Educate students on the signs of digital overuse and how it can impact mental wellbeing—even if they don’t perceive themselves as addicted.

- Tailor messaging by gender, highlighting the heightened emotional impact seen among female students.

- Targeted Interventions:
- In countries like the UK, consider partnering with schools or mental health organisations to support student wellbeing.

- Encourage use of social media monitoring tools or “digital detox” weeks

- Redefine Addiction Criteria:
- Explore revising how “addiction” is defined in future studies to better capture psychological and behavioural dependencies, beyond self-rated scales.

- Country-Specific Deep Dives:
- Conduct further qualitative research in standout countries like Australia and the Netherlands to identify successful habits that could be modeled elsewhere.




Academic and sleep insights:


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28357fc2-529b-468d-bb4b-a684e1d01e7d)


Sleep duration trends: 

•	Average sleep per night increases from the 0–2 hrs group up to the 6–7 hrs group (peaking at ~6.68 hrs).

•	It then drops sharply in the 8+ hrs group (~6.32 hrs).

•	This suggests that moderate use (6–7 hrs) may align with better sleep, while excessive use (8+ hrs) may negatively impact sleep duration.

Mental Health Score Trends:

•	Highest mental health scores are found in the lowest usage groups (0–2 hrs and 3–5 hrs).

•	Scores decline steadily from the 3–5 hrs group onward.

•	The lowest mental health scores are in the 8+ hrs group (around 5.4), which is below the global student average (5.6).

 Key Observations:

1.	Higher daily social media use appears to negatively impact both sleep and mental wellbeing.

- Even students in the 6–7 hrs group (who sleep the most) report a noticeable drop in mental health.
- At 8+ hrs, both sleep and mental health are significantly lower than any other group.

2.	The healthiest balance appears to be in the 3–5 hrs group, where students report:

- Stronger mental health (just under 5.8)
- Almost the same amount of sleep as the highest sleep group (6.65 hrs)

3.	Students in the 8+ hrs group are consistently showing signs of overuse-related strain.

•	Sleep Disruption: Late-night scrolling and screen exposure may delay melatonin release, reducing sleep quantity and quality.

•	Mental Fatigue: Overexposure to content — especially social comparisons or distressing news — may increase anxiety or reduce emotional resilience.





Extremes in social media use appear less healthy:

0–2 hrs group has less sleep and highest academic impact — which may point to underlying stress or stricter self-regulation due to academic pressure.

8+ hrs users have poor sleep and lowest academic impact — which may suggest underreporting or reduced academic awareness.

Academic impact self-reporting may not align with actual risk.

The 8+ hrs group likely experiences real academic consequences (due to sleep and screen time), but may not perceive it or may normalise the impact.




Low usage group (0–2 hrs):

May represent high-achieving or anxious students who limit social media intentionally, but still feel academic pressure, which affects their sleep.

High usage group (8+ hrs):

Possibly disengaged or less academically motivated students — sleep is poor, but they underreport academic impact due to normalization or lack of awareness.

There isn’t a sharp sleep gap between addicted vs. non-addicted students, but perceived academic impact tends to coincide with slightly less sleep, hinting at possible stress or study disruption.

Some platforms — especially video-based ones like YouTube — seem to have less sleep impact compared to others like Instagram. This might relate to usage patterns (passive viewing vs. active scrolling or messaging).

The academic impact of social media use is consistently high across countries, but it’s particularly prominent in South Africa and the UK. This could relate to local education pressures, online habits, or access to support systems.

Addiction and sleep are both relevant to academic performance, but effects vary across student groups.

Platform type matters — students using more visual or interactive platforms (like Instagram or TikTok) tend to sleep less.


Recommendations:

Discourage overuse: Educate students about the risks of 8+ hrs/day, where both sleep and mental wellbeing are most negatively affected.

Implement digital wellbeing programs: Introduce or support tools that track screen time, suggest breaks, and set daily limits.

Promote "digital curfews": Encourage putting away devices at least 1 hour before bedtime to support better sleep quality.

Collaborate with schools to include sleep literacy in wellbeing or health curricula.

Expand access to support services: Offer digital counseling, peer support groups, or partnerships with mental health NGOs — especially targeting schools with high usage rates.

Don’t rely solely on self-reporting: Many students in the 8+ hrs group may not recognize or admit the academic impact — but the data shows clear links to poor sleep and lower engagement.

Embed support across academic systems:

Provide guidance sessions on balancing online time with study.

Encourage time management and offline study habits.

South Africa and the UK show higher academic impact. Prioritize targeted efforts in these countries, such as:

Partnering with local education authorities to run awareness campaigns.

Offering workshops in high-risk areas focused on digital balance and academic focus.

Consider cultural and socioeconomic factors influencing digital habits in each country when designing interventions.
