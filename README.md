# PowerBiSocialMediaAddiction
Power bi report analysing social media usage and it's impact on students 

Project Summary:
"Education for All" commissioned a global student survey to explore how social media usage relates to mental health, academic performance, and sleep. This dashboard summarises key findings from a sample of 250 students across multiple countries. Users can filter the dashboard by country, gender, or academic level to explore trends in more detail.

The following questions were requested by stakeholders from education for all :


1.	Addiction Prevalence
  -	What percentage of students meet the criteria for social media addiction?
  - How does this vary by country, gender, or academic level?
2.	Impact on Mental Health
  -	Are students with high usage or “addicted” status more likely to report lower mental health scores?
  - Are there visible differences in mental health by gender or region?
3.	Academic Performance Risk
  - How many students report that social media negatively affects their academic performance?
  - Is there a relationship between daily usage hours and reported academic issues?
4.	Sleep Disruption
  - What proportion of students sleep fewer than 6 hours per night?
  - Does sleep deprivation correlate with higher social media usage?
5.	Platform Usage Trends
  -  What are the most used platforms?
  - Are certain platforms more associated with negative outcomes

Key Findings (All Countries – Overall View)

•	Addiction Rate:

18% of students rated themselves 8 or higher out of 10 on the self-reported addiction scale and are categorised as “addicted.”

•	Daily Social Media Usage:

The average daily use across all students is 4.5 hours per day.

•	Mental Health:

The average self-reported mental health score is 5.6 out of 10, indicating moderate wellbeing with room for improvement.

•	Sleep Deprivation:

34% of students report getting less than 6 hours of sleep per night—a potential health risk and performance concern.

•	Platform Preferences:

The most frequently used platform is Facebook (45 users), followed by TikTok (39) and YouTube (37). Snapchat is the least reported primary platform.

•	Top Surveyed Countries:

The five countries with the most responses are Denmark, China, France, Spain, and South Korea.

Trends Over Time

•	Usage Spike in Q2 2022:
Daily usage peaked at 5.9 hours/day in Q2 2022, a 62.6% increase compared to the lowest point of 3.6 hours/day in Q1 2024.

•	Post-Spike Decline:

After the 2022 peak, average use dropped to 3.9 hours/day by Q4 of the same year, then stabilised between 4.5–4.9 hours/day in most quarters.

Key observations:

•	The spike in Q2 2022 may align with specific global or academic events—e.g., exam stress, post-pandemic habits, or limited outdoor/social activities.

•	The decline after 2022 could reflect platform fatigue or academic pressures pushing students to limit screen time.

•	Facebook’s popularity suggests students may still rely on established platforms for communication, even while TikTok and YouTube grow in entertainment and content engagement.


Recommendations:

1.	Promote Healthy Digital Habits:

- Use high-usage periods (e.g., Q2) as a trigger for targeted wellness campaigns and digital detox challenges.
- Encourage students to track and reflect on their social media time via built-in app usage monitors or university-supported tools.
- Link mental health resources with screen time guidance, particularly for students showing signs of high usage or addiction.

4.	Enable Country-Specific Analysis:

- Since behaviours vary across regions, empower schools or local partners to explore the dashboard using the Country filter, enabling localised action plans.

This section explores the relationship between students’ mental health and their level of social media usage, with a breakdown by gender, country, and usage time.
Key Observations:

	Gender & Addiction Impact on Mental Health:

- Among students not considered addicted, females report a slightly higher average mental health score (5.8) compared to males (5.5).
- Among those considered addicted, mental health scores are lower across both genders, with females at 4.8 and males at 5.2.
- Insight: Addiction to social media correlates with a noticeable decline in self-reported mental health, especially among females.

Country-Level Highlights:

- Australia stands out with the highest average mental health score of 7.3, well above the global average of 5.6.

- Male students using social media more than 8 hours/day report a perfect score of 10, while females using it 3–5 hours/day report a high score of 8.3.

- Despite high usage in some cases, only 13.3% of Australian students consider themselves addicted, lower than the global average of 18%.

- Potential reason: Students in Australia may have healthier digital habits, better support systems, or more awareness around mindful usage.

- Netherlands reports zero students self-identifying as addicted, despite some having high usage (8+ hours).

- Mental health scores for high-use students remain moderate (5–6), suggesting perception of addiction may vary culturally or that students do not associate time spent with addiction.

- Females in the Netherlands report a significantly higher average mental health score (7.8) compared to males (6.2).

- The UK has the lowest average mental health score among all countries surveyed, which may merit deeper investigation into broader student wellbeing and social pressures. They have 22% addicted rate with an average mental health score of 4.2. Close behind the UK with low mental health scores are France and Denmark


Usage Time vs. Mental Health:

- Students using social media 0–2 hours daily have relatively balanced mental health scores (5.7–5.8).

- Moderate users (3–5 hours/day) see a mixed impact:
- Females: 6.3
- Males: 5.4
- Heavy users (6–7+ hours/day) show declining mental health, with scores dropping to a range of 5.0–5.5 for both genders.

- Interpretation: Light to moderate use may not harm mental health, especially for females, but usage above 6 hours appears linked with a noticeable decline
