# PowerBiSocialMediaAddiction
Power bi report analysing social media usage and it's impact on students 

Project Summary:
"Education for All" commissioned a global student survey to explore how social media usage relates to mental health, academic performance, and sleep. This dashboard summarizes key findings from a sample of 250 students across multiple countries. Users can filter the dashboard by country, gender, or academic level to explore trends in more detail.

The following questions were requested by stakeholders from education for all :


1.	Addiction Prevalence
  -	What percentage of students meet the criteria for social media addiction?
  - How does this vary by country, gender, or academic level?
2.	Impact on Mental Health
  -	Are students with high usage or “addicted” status more likely to report lower mental health scores?
  - Are there visible differences in mental health by gender or region?
3.	Academic Performance Risk
  - How many students report that social media negatively affects their academic performance?
  - Is there a relationship between daily usage hours and reported academic issues?
4.	Sleep Disruption
  - What proportion of students sleep fewer than 6 hours per night?
  - Does sleep deprivation correlate with higher social media usage?
5.	Platform Usage Trends
  -  What are the most used platforms?
  - Are certain platforms more associated with negative outcomes

Key Findings (All Countries – Overall View)
•	Addiction Rate:
18% of students rated themselves 8 or higher out of 10 on the self-reported addiction scale and are categorized as “addicted.”
•	Daily Social Media Usage:
The average daily use across all students is 4.5 hours per day.
•	Mental Health:
The average self-reported mental health score is 5.6 out of 10, indicating moderate wellbeing with room for improvement.
•	Sleep Deprivation:
34% of students report getting less than 6 hours of sleep per night—a potential health risk and performance concern.
•	Platform Preferences:
The most frequently used platform is Facebook (45 users), followed by TikTok (39) and YouTube (37). Snapchat is the least reported primary platform.
•	Top Surveyed Countries:
The five countries with the most responses are Denmark, China, France, Spain, and South Korea.

Trends Over Time
•	Usage Spike in Q2 2022:
Daily usage peaked at 5.9 hours/day in Q2 2022, a 62.6% increase compared to the lowest point of 3.6 hours/day in Q1 2024.
•	Post-Spike Decline:
After the 2022 peak, average use dropped to 3.9 hours/day by Q4 of the same year, then stabilized between 4.5–4.9 hours/day in most quarters.

Key observations:
•	The spike in Q2 2022 may align with specific global or academic events—e.g., exam stress, post-pandemic habits, or limited outdoor/social activities.
•	The decline after 2022 could reflect platform fatigue or academic pressures pushing students to limit screen time.
•	Facebook’s popularity suggests students may still rely on established platforms for communication, even while TikTok and YouTube grow in entertainment and content engagement.
